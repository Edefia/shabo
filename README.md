#created some temporal looks for the artists and you may have to review it.

Also check the footer and the heading in responsive view. 

Does it meet your expectations?  _________

The menu toggle is yet to be done.

Also I figured we put the more details of the artist into Another page where i will redirect onClick events to that page. (that is why i made use of the View Portfolio link)

Also I figured instead of putting the rate on the home page, we should also put on the more detailed page and replace the rate on the home page with a span tag of the type of person. (Be it a Drummer, Bassist, ... ).

Does this also meet your expectations?  ________

Lastly i am going to send you a link from my amazon s3 bucket for you to view how far the project has gotten to.
